<h2>My top 3 favourite movies of all time</h2>

<h3>Ford Vs. Ferrari</h3>
<p>I really can't think of any other racing movie of the 2010s decade or the 21st century as a whole that was so much fun and as riveting as this one. Christian Bale is brilliant at playing the true character of Ken Miles and his unsung story which has been known by very little people until now of how Ford were able to construct the perfect racing machine to rival Ferrari's perfect winning streak on the 24 hour Le Mans circuit

    One of the best things I like the most about the movie is that not just how the racing action is directed and how the vehicle is shown, but also how it feels. The audio of the engine in this movie is impeccable on just how much pressure and stress Miles is putting on the engine and throttle at any given time, and just how he is able to perfectly stress the engine and sustain it for maximum endurance and figuring out just the right moment to push it just a little bit further for maximum performance. I really loved that touch that this movie has and I hope future racing movies learn from it. I also love how Miles explains this in many scenes, especially in one where he explains it perfectly to his son (did I also mention that the writing is impeccable) 
    
    Matt Damon as Carrol Shelby is also an amazing supporting character and Christian and Damon bounce off eachother very well and have an equal presence in the movie. Bale's acting is great as always. 
    
    I also love the cinematography and look of the movie. The directing of the racing action is incredible. The film visually is dripping with soul and atmosphere of the racing period where you can almost smell the fuming petrol and hot dripping sweat of the drives on the blistering Le Mans day and the cold dripping rain in the following storm.
    
    Overall I think it's a perfect racing flick and it's going to take a long while for another one to tell as great as a story as this one did and also being this much fun to watch all the way through</p>

<h3>Chernobyl</h3>
<p>'CHERNOBYL' is Ecstatically outstanding Mini series which tells the story of a disaster which we we're not asked or expecting...

    This mind-blowing 5 episode series which nails every part with its gorgeous Cinematography & eerie Music to compensate the Situations, There is this continuous 90 seconds take without cut in episode 4 shows us how labourous and tense the situation is, they even did some weird Filter on Video just like 'The Handmaids Tale' which gives certain kind of vibe that Show requires....
    
    First of all the fact that HBO greenlit this show is Intriguing as this causes some political differences, the total Chernobyl Disaster is a Cover-up, I don't know what they showed is exactly true but I'll buy it 'cause it not only makes outstanding scientific & political drama but every bit plausible as USSR never intended to make this known to public...
    
    The show starts with surprisingly unexpected conclusion to our favourite character which we get know why, it's engaging as hell and has some great amount of Science to learn & all the nerds find it even more exciting, the Dialogues are outstanding with some great Quotable stuff particularly the back & forth at the end of episode 4 & total episode 5(They killed it) and the Writing part is fantastic which keeps you at the edge of the seat about what bigger threat is on rails & all unveils due to the measures taken to prevent it....
    
    Jared Harris & Stellan Skarsgard dynamic is awesome and we can watch them whole day arguing about complicated decisions & it's consequences, the whole disaster thing is so massive that we can't even comphrend by just studying the incident reports online, we have to see it visually to understand the seriousness, For example it would atleast take 20000 years for Pripyat to be habitable and the work they put into this for clearing the mess includes evacuating 2600 square kilometres radius from Power Plant and killing everything within the radius of 100 sq.Kilometers seems nightmarish, all this is done by some technical department & big cover-up by nation that don't want to admit their inability to prevent these accidents is extravagant...
    
    Just watch it & feel the intense in every scene, the meticulous Writing of Science stuff in this show is beyond awesome, even Noobs can learn a great deal about this stuff, the fact that this show surpassed the IMDB ratings of GOT & Breaking Bad shows its potential....
    
    Watch this even if you mildly excite about science & want to feel the sheer thrill of Impotence.....
    
    10/10 Brilliantly done</p>
