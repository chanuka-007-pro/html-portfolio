<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Chanuka. I am a final year student in Curtin University completing Bachelor of Infomation Technology degree.</p>

<p>I started this web-development course to further sharpen my skills and get into areas that are not limited to my degree. So far I am getting the hang of it and by the end of this course I hope I will be able to build a website of my own.</p>
